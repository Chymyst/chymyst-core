# Other tutorials on Join Calculus

The present “chemical machine” tutorial is a non-theoretical introduction to Join Calculus for beginners.

This tutorial is based on my [earlier tutorial for JoCaml](https://sites.google.com/site/winitzki/tutorial-on-join-calculus-and-its-implementation-in-ocaml-jocaml). (However, be warned that the JoCaml tutorial is unfinished and probably contains some mistakes in some of the more advanced code examples.)

See also [my recent presentation at _Scala by the Bay 2016_](https://scalaebythebay2016.sched.org/event/7iU2/concurrent-join-calculus-in-scala).
([Talk slides are available](https://github.com/winitzki/talks/tree/master/join_calculus)).
That presentation covered an early version of `JoinRun`.

There are a few academic papers on Join Calculus and a few expository descriptions, such as the Wikipedia article or the JoCaml documentation.
Unfortunately, I cannot recommend reading them - they are unsuitable for learning about the chemical paradigm.

I learned about the “Reflexive Chemical Abstract Machine” from the introduction in one of the [early papers on Join Calculus](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.32.3078&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
(Initially I was able to understand _only_ the introduction part in that paper!)

Do not start by reading these papers if you are a beginner in Join Calculus - you will only be unnecessarily confused, because those texts are intended for advanced computer scientists and not pedagogically appropriate for beginners.
