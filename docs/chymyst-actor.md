# From actors to reactions: The chemical machine explained through the Actor model

Many Scala developers interested in concurrent programming are already familiar with the Actor model. In this brief chapter, I outline how the chemical machine paradigm can be introduced to those readers.

In the Actor model, an actor receives messages and reacts to them by running a computation. An actor-based program declares several actors, defines the computations for them, stores references to the actors, and starts sending messages to some of the actors. Messages are sent either synchronously or asynchronously, enabling communication between different concurrent actors. 

The chemical machine paradigm is in certain ways similar to the Actor model. A chemical program also consists of concurrent processes, or “chemical actors”, that communicate by sending messages. The chemical machine paradigm departs from the Actor model in two major ways: 

1. Chemical actors are automatically started and stopped; the user's code only sends messages and does not manipulate actor references.
2. Chemical actors may wait for a set of different messages to be received atomically.

If we examine these requirements and determine what should logically follow from them, we will arrive at the chemical machine paradigm.

The first requirement means that chemical actors are not created explicitly by the user's program. Instead, the chemical machine runtime will automatically instantiate and run a chemical actor whenever some process sends a relevant input message. A chemical actor will be automatically stopped and deleted when its computation is finished. Therefore, the user's code now does not create an instance of an actor but merely _defines the computation_ that an auto-created actor will perform after consuming a message. As a consequence, a chemical actor must be _stateless_ and only perform computations that are functions of the input message values.

Implementing this functionality will allow us to write pseudo-code like this,

```scala
val c1 = go { x: Int ⇒ ... }
c1 ! 123

```

The computation labeled as `c1` receives a message with an `Int` value and performs some processing on it. The computation will be instantiated and run concurrently, whenever a message is sent. In this way, we made the first step towards the full chemical machine paradigm. 

What should happen if we quickly send many messages?

```scala
val c1 = go { x: Int ⇒ ... }
(1 to 100).foreach { c1 ! _ }

```

Since our computations are stateless, it is safe to run several instances of the computation `c1` concurrently. The runtime engine may automatically adjust the degree of parallelism depending on CPU load.

Note that `c1` is not a reference to a particular instance of a computation. Rather, the computation `{ x: Int ⇒ ... }` is being defined _declaratively_, as a description of what needs to be done with any message sent via `c1`. We could say that the value `c1` plays the role of a _label_ attached to the value `123`. The label implies that the value `123` should be used as the input parameter `x` in a particular computation. To express this semantics more clearly, let us change our pseudo-code notation to

```scala
go { x: Int from c1 ⇒ ... }
c1 ! 123

```

Different chemical actors are now distinguished only by their input message labels, for example:

```scala
go { x: Int from c1 ⇒ ... }
go { x: Int from d1 ⇒ ... }
c1 ! 123
d1 ! 456

```

Actor references have disappeared from the code. Instead, input message labels such as `c1`, `d1` select the computation that will be started.

The second requirement means that a chemical actor should be able to wait for, say, two messages at once, allowing us to write pseudo-code like this,

```scala
go { x: Int from c1, y: String from c2 ⇒ ... }
c1 ! 123
c2 ! "abc"

```

The two messages are of different types and are labeled by `c1` and `c2` respectively. The computation starts only after _both_ messages have been sent, and consumes both messages atomically.

It follows that messages cannot be sent to a linearly ordered queue or a mailbox. Instead, messages must be kept in an unordered bag, as they will be consumed in an unknown order.

It also follows from the atomicity requirement that we may define several computations that _jointly contend_ on input messages:

```scala
go { x: Int from c1, y: String from c2 ⇒ ... }
go { x: Int from c1, z: Unit from e1 ⇒ ... }

```

Messages that carry data are now completely decoupled from computations that consume the data. All computations start concurrently whenever their input messages become available. The runtime engine needs to resolve message contention by making a non-deterministic choice of the messages that will be actually consumed.

This concludes the second and final step towards the chemical machine paradigm. It remains to use the Scala syntax instead of pseudo-code.

In Scala, we need to declare message types explicitly and to register chemical computations with the runtime engine as a separate step.
The syntax used by `Chymyst` looks like this:

```scala
val c1 = m[Int]
val c2 = m[String]
site(go { c1(x) + c2(y) ⇒ ... })
c1(123)
c2("abc")

```

Here, `m[Int]` creates a new message label with values of type `Int`.

As we have just seen, the chemical machine paradigm is a radical departure from the Actor model:

- Whenever there are sufficiently many input messages available for processing, the runtime engine may automatically instantiate several concurrent copies of the same computation that will consume the input messages concurrently. This is the main method for achieving parallelism in the chemical paradigm. The runtime engine is in the best position to balance the CPU load using low-level OS threads. The application code does not need to decide how many concurrent actors to instantiate at any given time.
- Since chemical actors are stateless and instantiated automatically on demand, users do not need to implement actor lifecycle management, actor supervision hierarchies, backup and recovery of actors' internal state, or a special “dead letter” actor. This removes a significant amount of complexity from the architecture of concurrent applications.
- Input message contention is used in the chemical machine paradigm as a general mechanism for synchronization and mutual exclusion. (In the Actor model, these features are implemented by creating a fixed number of actor instances that alone can consume certain messages.) Since the runtime engine will arbitrarily decide which actor to run, input contention will result in nondeterminism. This is quite similar to the nondeterminism in the usual models of concurrent programming. For example, mutual exclusion allows the programmer to implement safe exclusive access to a resource for any number of concurrent processes, but the order of access among the contending processes remains unspecified.

In the rest of this book, “chemical actor” computations are called **reactions**, their input messages are **input molecules**,
messages sent by a chemical computation are **output molecules** of the reaction, while input message labels are **molecule emitters**.

In the academic literature, chemical computations are called “processes” and input message labels are “channels” or “channel names”.
