# `Chymyst`: declarative concurrency in Scala

`Chymyst` is a framework for concurrency in functional programming
implementing the **chemical machine** paradigm, also known in the academic world as [Join Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join-calculus).
The chemical machine concurrency paradigm has the same expressive power as CSP ([Communicating Sequential Processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes)) or [the Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model).

[`Chymyst Core`](https://github.com/Chymyst/chymyst-core) is a library that implements the high-level concurrency primitives as a domain-specific language in Scala.
[`Chymyst`](https://github.com/Chymyst/Chymyst) is a framework-in-planning that will build upon `Chymyst Core` and bring declarative concurrency to practical applications.

The code of `Chymyst Core` is based on previous Join Calculus implementations by He Jiansen (https://github.com/Jiansen/ScalaJoin, 2011) and Philipp Haller (http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~phaller/joins/index.html, 2008), as well as on my earlier prototypes in [Objective-C/iOS](https://github.com/winitzki/CocoaJoin) and [Java/Android](https://github.com/winitzki/AndroJoin).

## Status

The `Chymyst Core` library is in alpha pre-release, with very few API changes envisioned for the future.

The semantics of the chemical machine (restricted to single-host, multicore computations) is fully implemented and tested on many nontrivial examples.

The library JAR is published to Maven Central.

Extensive tutorial and usage documentation is available.

Unit tests include examples such as asynchronous counter, parallel “or”, concurrent merge-sort, and “dining philosophers”.
Test coverage is [100% according to codecov.io](https://codecov.io/gh/Chymyst/chymyst-core?branch=master).

Performance benchmarks indicate that `Chymyst Core` can schedule about 100,000 reactions per second per CPU core, and the performance bottleneck is in submitting jobs to threads (a distant second bottleneck is pattern-matching in the internals of the library).
