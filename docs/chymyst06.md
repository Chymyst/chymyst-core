# Previous work

Here are previous implementations of Join Calculus that I was able to find.

- The `Funnel` programming language: [M. Odersky et al., 2000](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/funnel/). This project was discontinued.
- _Join Java_: [von Itzstein et al., 2001-2005](http://www.vonitzstein.com/Project_JoinJava.html). This was a modified Java language compiler, with support for certain Join Calculus constructions. The project is not maintained.
- The `JoCaml` language: [Official site](http://jocaml.inria.fr) and a publication about JoCaml: [Fournet et al. 2003](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/fournet/papers/jocaml-afp4-summer-school-02.pdf). This is a dialect of OCaml implemented as a patch to the OCaml compiler. The project is still supported.
- “Join in Scala” compiler patch: [V. Cremet 2003](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~cremet/misc/join_in_scala/index.html). The project is discontinued.
- Joins library for .NET: [P. Crusso 2006](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/crusso/joins/). The project is available as a binary .NET download from Microsoft Research.
- `ScalaJoins`, a prototype implementation in Scala: [P. Haller 2008](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~phaller/joins/index.html). The project is not maintained.
- `ScalaJoin`: an improvement over `ScalaJoins`, [J. He 2011](https://github.com/Jiansen/ScalaJoin). The project is not maintained.
- Joinads, a not-quite-Join-Calculus implementation in F# and Haskell: [Petricek and Syme 2011](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/joinads-a-retargetable-control-flow-construct-for-reactive-parallel-and-concurrent-programming/). The project is not maintained.
- Proof-of-concept implementations of Join Calculus for iOS: [CocoaJoin](https://github.com/winitzki/AndroJoin) and Android: [AndroJoin](https://github.com/winitzki/AndroJoin). These projects are not maintained.

The implementation in `JoinRun` is based on ideas from Jiansen He's `ScalaJoin` as well as on CocoaJoin / AndroJoin.

# Other tutorials on Join Calculus

The present “chemical machine” tutorial is a non-theoretical introduction to Join Calculus for beginners.

This tutorial is based on my [earlier tutorial for JoCaml](https://sites.google.com/site/winitzki/tutorial-on-join-calculus-and-its-implementation-in-ocaml-jocaml). (However, be warned that the JoCaml tutorial is unfinished and probably contains some mistakes in some of the more advanced code examples.)

See also [my recent presentation at _Scala by the Bay 2016_](https://scalaebythebay2016.sched.org/event/7iU2/concurrent-join-calculus-in-scala).
([Talk slides are available](https://github.com/winitzki/talks/tree/master/join_calculus)).
That presentation covered an early version of `JoinRun`.

There are a few academic papers on Join Calculus and a few expository descriptions, such as the Wikipedia article or the JoCaml documentation.
Unfortunately, I cannot recommend reading them - they are unsuitable for learning about the chemical paradigm.

I learned about the “Reflexive Chemical Abstract Machine” from the introduction in one of the [early papers on Join Calculus](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.32.3078&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
(Initially I was able to understand _only_ the introduction part in that paper!)

Do not start by reading these papers if you are a beginner in Join Calculus - you will only be unnecessarily confused, because those texts are intended for advanced computer scientists and not pedagogically appropriate for beginners.
